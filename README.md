Minecraft undetectable live structure finder without mods.

When running the run.py script it finds the newest minecraft world in '%appdata%/.minecraft/saves/*'. Whenever you start a new minecraft world, it will stop searching the old world and starts searching in the new world.

The script only looks for rendered structures. The script is undetectable by third parties.

Keep an eye out for new lines in the console. If you see a new line, it means that the script found a new structure.
The coordinates in the console directly corresponds to the 'CHUNK'-coordinate of the structure. (This means that you still should do the buried treasure trick in the chunk for example).

DISCLAIMER: Do not use this in speedruns; this will probably count as cheating.
