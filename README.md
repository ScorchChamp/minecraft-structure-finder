👋 Welcome to the Minecraft Undetectable Live Structure Finder!

Are you tired of spending hours upon hours scouring your Minecraft world for structures? Do you want to easily find them without the use of mods? Look no further! 🎉

Our script, run.py, will automatically detect the newest Minecraft world in '%appdata%/.minecraft/saves/\*' and search for rendered structures in real-time. That's right, no more wasting time searching for structures that have already been rendered.

Our script is completely undetectable by third parties 😎, so you don't have to worry about any complicated mods or add-ons - our script does all the work for you! ⚡️

Keep an eye on the console for new lines - this means that the script has found a new structure! 🤩 The coordinates in the console directly correspond to the 'CHUNK'-coordinate of the structure, making it even easier to find buried treasures and other hidden gems. 🚀

Please note that this script is not intended for use in speedruns, as it could be considered cheating.

🌎 Automatic Detection: The script automatically detects the newest Minecraft world in '%appdata%/.minecraft/saves/*', so you don't have to worry about selecting the right world.

🔍 Coordinate Correspondence: The coordinates in the console directly correspond to the 'CHUNK'-coordinate of the structure, making it even easier to find buried treasures and other hidden gems.
